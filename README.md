# GSoC_2024-Enhanced_Media_Experience_with_AI-Powered_Commercial_Detection_and_Replacement

## About the Project 

The BeagleBoneÂ® AI-64 from the BeagleBoard.org Foundation is a complete system for developing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning solutions with the convenience and expandability of the BeagleBone platform and onboard peripherals to start learning and building applications. Leveraging the powerful processing units of BeagleBoard, the project will focus on creating a real-time, efficient solution that enhances media consumption experiences by seamlessly integrating custom audio streams during commercial breaks.
In this project, I'll be working on developing GStreamer plugins for multimedia processing, with a focus on commercial detection and replacement using deep learning. The goal is to create an educational resource that demonstrates how to integrate AI and machine learning capabilities into BeagleBone AI-64 while tackling a real-world problem.
